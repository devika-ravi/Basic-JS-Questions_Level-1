            The electricity board charges different tariffs based on the unit's consumption. <br> 
            - Charges for first 50 units are 2.60 Rs.<br>
            - Charges for the next 50 units are 3.25 Rs.<br>
            - Charges for the next 100 units are 5.65 Rs.<br>
            - And if the consumption unit is greater than 200 , charge should be 7.25<br>
            - and there should be apply 0.5% tariff charge if the overall consumption is greater than 700 units.</h4>
